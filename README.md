FunSim is a functional connectivity neuron simulator web application developed by Research Computing Support staff in the [Lewis-Seigler Institute for Integrative Genomics](https://lsi.princeton.edu/) and the
[Leifer Lab](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu/).

This web-app allows you to simulate responses of downstream neurons to the
stimulation of other neurons using the functional connectivity data measured by
[Randi et al., Nature
(2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4), measured via
simultaneous single-cell optogenetics and whole-brain imaging.
