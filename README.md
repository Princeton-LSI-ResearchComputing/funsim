FunSim (Beta) is a functional connectivity neuron simulator web application
developed by the [Leifer Lab](http://leiferlab.princeton.edu/) and Research
Computing Support staff in the Lewis-Seigler Institute for Integrative Genomics
and the Prineeton Neuroscience Institute.

This web-app allows you to simulate responses of downstream neurons to the
stimulation of other neurons using the functional connectivity data measured by
Randi et al. (2022), measured via simultaneous single-cell optogenetics and
whole-brain imaging.

To report a bug or feature request, open a new issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/neuron-simulator/issues). There you
can also see, follow, and comment on known bugs and feature requests.

Alternatively, send us an [email](mailto:leifer@princeton.edu).

This project is in beta and has not yet been peer reviewed.
